The aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility of reducing the noise of noisy images
acquired by arterial spin labeling (ASL). ASL is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method based on cerebral perfusion without contrast
contrast medium. The problem is therefore as follows: To what extent do modern techniques
standard techniques in terms of noise reduction in images acquired by arterial spin labeling?
acquired by arterial spin labeling?
To answer this question, we tested three denoising algorithms, modern deep learning algorithms, namely the Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) and the other a convolutional neural network learning algorithm for convolutional neural network (DnCNN). The third algorithm is the classical non-local mean-based filtering "Non-Local Means" (NLmeans). On the other hand, the performance of these three algorithms was evaluated and analyzed using
PSNR "Peak Signal to Noise Ratio", an image quality evaluation indicator.
